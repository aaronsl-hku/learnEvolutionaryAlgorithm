# learnEvolutionaryAlgorithm

My personal journal on learning Evolutionary Algorithms

## TODO's

- Try to use `https://tsplib95.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/usage.html` for reading `.tsp`s.

## Readings

### Genetic Algorithm

- [ ] [A Comparative Study of Adaptive Crossover Operators for Genetic Algorithms to Resolve the Traveling Salesman Problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.3097.pdf)
  - Crossover operators for individuals in indices.

## PyGAD

(Not going to continue to use this package. Deap seems to be a better option for having more flexibility on self-defined operators and individuals.)
