# learnEvolutionaryAlgorithm

My personal journal on learning Evolutionary Algorithms

To start with, run in **bash /  zsh**

```bash
source activate
```

## Milestones

- [x] one_max and knapsack as starter
- [x] tsp - able to solve gr17
- [ ] tsp - able to solve larger problems: gr21, gr24, gr48 and gr96
- [ ] vrp problems - vanilla
- [ ] vrp variants

## Readings

### Genetic Algorithm for discrete spaces (permutations and list of sets)

- [x] Evolutionary Algorithms (Chapter 4.3. Order-based Representation and variation operators)
- [ ] Evolutionary Algorithms (Entire Chapter 4)

## PyGAD

(Not going to continue to use this package. Deap seems to be a better option for having more flexibility on self-defined operators and individuals.)
