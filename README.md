# learnEvolutionaryAlgorithm

My personal journal on learning Evolutionary Algorithms

## TODO's

- Try to use `https://tsplib95.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/usage.html` for reading `.tsp`s.
- See how to configure the tsp

## Readings

### Genetic Algorithm

- [ ] Evolutionary Algorithms (Chapter 4.3. Order-based Representation and variation operators)

## PyGAD

(Not going to continue to use this package. Deap seems to be a better option for having more flexibility on self-defined operators and individuals.)
